# ðŸ¤– AI Usage Disclosure

## Tool Used

* **ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI)**

## Purpose of AI Use

AI was used in the development of this project to:

* Compare correct and incorrect implementations of modules (`executor.py`, `runner.py`, `utils.py`, `example.yaml`)
* Generate structured commit messages
* Draft documentation (`README.md`, `findings.md`, and this file)
* Suggest refactoring improvements and better practices

## Scope of AI Involvement

The following files or decisions involved AI-assisted contributions:

* `executor.py`: function structure comparison, improvements in context rendering and error handling
* `runner.py`: improved scenario loading and default path resolution
* `utils.py`: recursive template rendering and better logging
* `example.yaml`: corrected API URLs and assertion formats
* `README.md`: full structure and content
* `findings.md`: identifying differences between correct and incorrect implementations

## Human Review and Verification

All AI-generated code and content were:

* Reviewed and edited by the user
* Tested using the provided FastAPI mock server
* Verified for alignment with test case requirements

## Why It Was Helpful

Using AI helped:

* Save time on repetitive documentation
* Quickly identify bugs and mismatches
* Maintain consistency and clean project structure
